		<h1>Hello, I am Mohamed Osman I. Musa .</h1>
		<p>I found my self lost in this world. I have lots of interests. I get bored so quickly</p>
		<p>I am not interested by the mundane, the boring, the typical, the Status Quo. 
		I get excited only by magical endeavour. building, or I would rather say, Creating
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It happened that I loved the field of Computers. how you can build something that can think, 
		out of a set of metals, wires and silicon. How you have in front of you an infinite possibility to 
		write commands, and control what you want. How you only need the machine, and the gray matter, that is your brain. 
		</p>
		
		<p>I think of crazy Ideas sometimes. what if the whole foundation of the digital revolution is sub-optimal?.
		what if the rather than perform a function in a mechanical step by step approach where a gate feeds into another gate is flawed?
		what if it can all gates are connected to the inputs and to all outputs? and the final output is the average of all outputs? what if the democratic system could work?</p>
